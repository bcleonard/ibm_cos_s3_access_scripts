# IBM COS S3 Access Scripts
This is a simple set of bash scripts to access an on-premise IBM COS Solution with S3 Access Key Authentication.

* getS3 - script which will download a object from a bucket to a file
* listS3 - script which will list objects in bucket
* putS3 - script which will upload a file to a bucket
